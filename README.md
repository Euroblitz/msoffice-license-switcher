# msoffice-license-switcher
Batch scripts made in .vbs to easily add and remove Microsoft Office license keys. Useful for testing a big number of keys bought by a reseller.

## For adding a key
Usage: Run "keyAdd.vbs" (it will ask for adming privileges), paste the key and confirm, and open Office to check if the activation works.

## For removing a key
Usage: Run "keyRemove.vbs" (it will ask for adming privileges), paste the key and delete everything else except the last 5 digits and confirm, and open Office to check if the activation works.
